After Job had prayed for his freinds, the Lord made him pros-
perous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.  All
his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before
came and ate with him in his house.  They comforted and consoled
him over all the trouble teh Lord had brought upon him, and each
one gave him a peice of silver and gold ring.

The Lord blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the
first.  He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels,
a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand dokeys.  And he also
had seven sons and three daughters.  The first daughter was
named Dove, the second Cinnamon and the third Eyeshadow Kit.
Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beutiful as
Job's daughters, and their father grante them an inheritance
along with their brothers.

After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his
children and their children to teh fourth generation.  And so
he died, old and full of years.
